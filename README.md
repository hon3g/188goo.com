<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://us-188.com/纽约)

There are many classified advertisements websites available in the Chinese immigrant community; however, I didn't find one that's simple, mobile friendly, and easy to use. I want to create a simple and beautiful website for job seekers and apartment renters to easily find what they are looking for as well as for advertisers to effortlessly create posts.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others

### Built With
* Python Django Backend
* JavaScript React Frontend
* AWS (EC2, RDS SQL, S3, CloudFront, and VPC)
* Google Cloud (Authentication, Realtime NoSQL, and Storage)
